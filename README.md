## üöÄ Getting Started

You can run this project locally using `bun`, `pnpm`, or `npm`. Bun is recommended for the fastest performance.

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/moonshadowrev/moonshadow.me-portfolio.git
cd moonshadow.me-portfolio
```

### 2. Install Dependencies

Choose your preferred package manager:

```bash
# With Bun (Recommended)
bun install

# With PNPM
pnpm install

# With NPM
npm install
```

### 3. Run the Development Server

This will start the Vite development server with Hot Module Replacement (HMR).

```bash
# With Bun
bun run dev

# With PNPM or NPM
pnpm run dev
# or
npm run dev
```

Open http://localhost:5173 (or the port shown in your terminal) to view it in the browser.

## üì¶ Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run the following commands:

- `dev`: Starts the development server.
- `build`: Bundles the app for production into the `dist` folder.
- `build:dev`: Bundles the app in development mode (unminified).
- `preview`: Serves the production build locally to preview it.
- `lint`: Runs ESLint to analyze the code for potential errors and style issues.
